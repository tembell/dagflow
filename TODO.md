# TODO

## Examples
- [ ] use a react state in the basic react example to complete the example
- [ ] use better data for the react example

## Core
- [ ] add support for multi head flows
- [ ] create a helper to build the graph
  - meaning, we should split logic of a node for 'runtime' and 'build' time
  - for example addChild, and funnelTo should be part of build, while isLeaf, resolve and reset is runtime.

## React
- [ ] create tests with react testing library
- [ ] test for rerender, maybe find a better way to handle sync with react


## CI
- [ ] add changeset for versioning and changelog
- [ ] add a github action to run tests
- [ ] add a github action to build the library
- [ ] add a github action to publish the library

## Docs
- [ ] add a docs site
